# Monthly analysis

These notebooks are to document the development and procedures for running the monthly analysis. It has two objectives:

1. Measure the lightcurves for all sources that are detectable in the 6-year analysis
2. Detect _transients_, that is, variable sources that are detectable in a single month, but not over 72 months.
